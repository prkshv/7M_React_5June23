Keys: iterable object
keys method doesn't change the original array

keys calls the index of array
map calls the value of the array

javascript is a object

npm: node package manager
used for react libraries installation

7th June 2023

react js is an open source library

framework: provides additional features
libraries: packages of some function which we can use to build UI

React js is used for frontend only
it doesn't need an API to work

Component based structure: one page is considered as one Component
single page application: perform actions without reloading the entire page

npm list react

npx: node package runner: installs packages only for that directory
npm: globally installs the package

node_modules: list of all packages
folder that maintain packages library. set of packages to develop that project

public folder:
index.html: template file which is served

manifest.json:
helps in mobile app to use web application
data is in json format

robots.txt:
for browser usage. for browser limitations

life cycle:
development
testing
production
deployment

no changes in public folder

app.css:
styles of react Components

app.js:
basic react Component which can be replaced by our Component
most changes are done in app.js file

app.test.js:
used for testing purpose

index.css:
global style file

reportwebvitals.js:
for performance

setuptest.js: testing file

.gitignore:
if uploaded on git, specifies the list of folder which we want to ignore from uploading

package.json:
all the packages which are used in creating project.
If new package installed. it is stored in this file

subpackages needed to develop the main package mentioned in package.json

Component: core building block of react
basically they are pages
reusable structure
Components provide meta data about data

types: functional and class Components
class Components are outdated

functional Component:
simple js function

when creating Component give first letter in upper case

jsx: xml content + js 

import react if you want to use the funcationality of react in any file

8th June 23
we use render method with class Components

render: redirects the page

app.js all Components are in <div> because it is considered as single element in react

we can send class Component through functional Component and vice versa

<></> fragment or blank

functional components is called stateless component
class component is called statefull component

difference between functional component and class component

functional component:
simple functions
use functions component as much as possible
this keyword is not used
solution without using state
mainly responsible for UI
stateless/dumb/presentational component

class component:
more feature rich
maintain their own private data
complex ui logic
it uses the oops concepts
provide lifecycle hooks
stateful/smart/container

jsx:
extension of javascript
makes react code simple and elegant
allows to write html in react by converting into react component

component: provide metadata/data about data
state: continuously changing vlaues
hooks: additional info about funcational component
provide lifecycle of the component

RSF to create component template

props: variables,
properties,
type of object,
similar to html attributes

props are read only
state changes. once change component re-renders

props:
read only
immutable
allows to pass data from one component to other component as an argument
props can be accessed by child component
props are used to communicate between Components
stateless components can have props (internal state:stateful)
props make component reusable
props are external and controlled by whatever render the component

state:
state changes can be asynchronous
state mutable
state holds information about component
state can't be accessed by child component
state can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component
stateless component cannot have state
